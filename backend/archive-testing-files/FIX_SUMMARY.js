/**
 * SUMMARY OF FIXES FOR THEATER ADMIN ORDER ACCESS
 * =================================================
 * 
 * PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
 * -------------------
 * 1. JWT token was missing 'userType' field - only included 'role'
 * 2. Frontend error handling logic was backwards (showing errors for AbortErrors)
 * 3. Backend role filtering used req.user._id instead of req.user.userId
 * 4. Role checking logic wasn't comprehensive enough
 * 
 * FIXES APPLIED:
 * --------------
 * 
 * 1. backend/routes/auth.js (Line 12-25)
 *    - Added 'userType' to JWT token payload
 *    - This ensures req.user.userType is available in all authenticated requests
 * 
 * 2. backend/routes/orders.js (Lines 401-428)
 *    - Improved role-based filtering logic
 *    - Clear distinction between:
 *      * Super Admin/Admin ‚Üí See ALL orders
 *      * Theater Admin ‚Üí See ALL theater orders
 *      * Theater User (staff) ‚Üí See ONLY their own orders
 *    - Fixed userId reference (was _id, now userId)
 *    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
 * 
 * 3. frontend/src/pages/theater/TheaterOrderHistory.js (Lines 211-225)
 *    - Fixed error handling logic
 *    - Now properly shows error messages for real errors
 *    - Silently ignores AbortErrors (from cancelled requests)
 * 
 * HOW TO TEST:
 * ------------
 * 1. Restart backend server (to load the changes)
 * 2. Clear browser localStorage or logout/login to get new JWT token
 * 3. Login as Theater Admin (username: 'admin' or 't-admin')
 *    - Should see ALL orders in order history
 * 4. Login as Theater User (username: 'manager', 'canteen', or 'sabarish')
 *    - Should see ONLY orders they created
 * 
 * VERIFICATION STEPS:
 * -------------------
 * 1. Theater Admin sees all orders regardless of who created them
 * 2. Regular staff only sees their own orders
 * 3. No "Failed to load orders" error on page load
 * 4. Proper error messages if authentication fails
 * 
 * DATABASE INFO FROM TEST:
 * ------------------------
 * Theater: YQ PAY NOW (ID: 68ed25e6962cb3e997acc163)
 * 
 * Users:
 * - admin (Theater Admin) ‚Üí Should see ALL orders
 * - t-admin (Theater Admin) ‚Üí Should see ALL orders
 * - manager (Manager/Staff) ‚Üí Should see only manager's orders
 * - canteen (Manager/Staff) ‚Üí Should see only canteen's orders
 * - sabarish (Manager/Staff) ‚Üí Should see only sabarish's orders
 * 
 * Current Orders: 1 order created by 'manager'
