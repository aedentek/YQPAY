## üîÑ Carry Forward Logic

### How Carry Forward Works:

1. **Month Creation:**
   - When viewing a month, system checks previous month's closing balance
   - This becomes the current month's opening balance (Carry Forward)

2. **Dynamic Updates:**
   - If previous month's data changes, carry forward automatically updates
   - System recalculates all balances when carry forward changes

3. **Carry Forward Loop:**
   ```
   September Closing Balance (120) 
   ‚Üí October Opening Balance (120) 
   ‚Üí October Closing Balance (570)
   ‚Üí November Opening Balance (570)
   ‚Üí ... continues
   ```

### Example Flow:
```
September 2025:
  Opening: 0
  Added: 120
  Sales: 0
  Expired: 0
  Damaged: 0
  Closing: 120  ‚Üê This carries forward

October 2025:
  Opening: 120  ‚Üê Carried from September
  Added: 450
  Sales: 0
  Expired: 0
  Damaged: 0
  Closing: 570  ‚Üê This carries forward

November 2025:
  Opening: 570  ‚Üê Carried from October
  ...
```

## ‚è∞ Auto-Expiry System

### Expiry Rules:

**When Items Expire:**
- Items expire at **00:01 AM the day AFTER the expiry date**
- Example: Expiry Date = 16 Oct 2025 ‚Üí Expires at 17 Oct 2025 00:01 AM

### Cross-Month Expiry Handling:

**Scenario:** Stock added in September with expiry in October

```javascript
September Entry:
  Entry Date: 10/09/2025
  Stock Added: 120
  Expiry Date: 17/10/2025
  
// On 10 Sept - 16 Oct: Entry shows in September as valid stock
September:
  Carry Forward: 0
  Total Added: 120
  Total Expired: 0  ‚Üê Not expired yet
  Closing Balance: 120

// On 17 Oct 00:01 AM: Auto-expiry triggers
September:
  Carry Forward: 0
  Total Added: 120
  Total Expired: 120  ‚Üê Auto-updated!
  Closing Balance: 0  ‚Üê Recalculated!

October:
  Carry Forward: 0  ‚Üê Updated from September's new closing
  Total Added: 450
  Total Expired: 0
  Closing Balance: 450
```

### Auto-Expiry Triggers:

1. **When viewing stock data** - System checks ALL months for expired items
2. **When adding entries** - Pre-check before saving
3. **Cross-month detection** - Scans entire product history, not just current month

### Key Features:

‚úÖ **Automatic Detection:** No manual marking needed
‚úÖ **Cross-Month Support:** Detects expiry regardless of which month you're viewing
‚úÖ **Balance Recalculation:** All month balances update automatically
‚úÖ **Carry Forward Update:** Next month's opening balance adjusts automatically
‚úÖ **Product Stock Sync:** Product's currentStock updates to latest closing balance

## üìê Calculation Formula

### Overall Balance Formula:
```
Overall Balance = Carry Forward + Total Added - Total Sales - Total Expired - Total Damaged
```

### Components:

- **Carry Forward:** Previous month's closing balance
- **Total Added:** New stock received this month
- **Total Sales:** Stock sold/used this month
- **Total Expired:** Stock expired this month (includes carry forward items)
- **Total Damaged:** Stock damaged this month

### Verification:
The Overall Balance card should **always match** the Total Balance (Closing Balance).

If they don't match, there's a calculation error.

## üéØ Important Notes

### 1. Carry Forward Only:
- Only the **closing balance** carries forward to next month
- Individual transactions (Added, Sales, Expired, Damaged) start fresh each month
- This prevents double-counting and maintains accuracy

### 2. Expiry Month Recording:
- The system **records which month the expiry occurred**
- Expired stock appears in the month it actually expires, not the entry month
- This ensures accurate monthly reports

### 3. Total Integrity:
- Without proper expiry month tracking, totals collapse
- Example of wrong calculation:
  ```
  ‚ùå WRONG: September shows 120 expired, October also shows 120 expired
  ‚úÖ CORRECT: September shows 120 expired, October shows 0 expired
  ```

### 4. Database Structure:
Each monthly document tracks:
- `carryForward` - Opening balance
- `totalStockAdded` - Sum of all added entries
- `totalUsedStock` - Sum of all sales
- `totalExpiredStock` - Sum of all expired (updated by auto-expiry)
- `totalDamageStock` - Sum of all damaged
- `closingBalance` - Final calculated balance
